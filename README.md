### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a M.S. at National Taiwan University. My background is the `Geophysics/Seismology` to explore Earth interior. My study focuses on `seismic anisotropy` beneath the Caucasus region. 

- ðŸ”­ I usually analyze time-series data to insight the meanings. I'm good at data visualization to help anyone understand data easily. 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I joined international collboration - [Oldest@2](http://eri-ndc.eri.u-tokyo.ac.jp/PacificArray/Oldest-2/) to deploy ocean-bottom seismograph(OBS) and ocean-bottom electro-magnetometer(OBEM). To learn more about the deployment/recovery of OBS, click [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yN_EWkIdX0k)
